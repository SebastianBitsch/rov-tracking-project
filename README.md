#### Final project 34763 Autonomous Marine Robotics 
## Group 2: Sensor-based underwater tracking of marine object
The aim of this project is to develop a real-time locating and tracking solution of marine object(s) using a [BlueROV2](https://bluerobotics.com/learn/bluerov2-operation/) autonomous ROV. 
The solution is developed in ROS Noetic as a wrapper around the BlueROV2 ROS package and works entirely in simulation using Gazebo and Rviz.

The code contains 3 main parts each of which is a ROS package for ease of use:
1. Instantiating and moving an object of interest (ooi) in Gazebo for the ROV to find and track. Located in ROS package [rov_ooi](/rov_ooi)
2. Locating and tracking the OOI (tbd)
3. The control algorithm for following the object once located
